# Quantum Leap Engine

## Idea
The main goal is to create a game engine and a game to demonstrate it's abilities.
It's supposed to be a type of engine similar to the hedgehog engine used to make sonic 06.

## Made With
This project is dependent on the following libraries
* https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
* https://github.com/nigels-com/glew.git
* https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3.git
* https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git

If copying the project from scratch enter the lib directory and git clone all the projects into there.
